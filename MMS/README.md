Steps to run experiments on pre-made training data with QMCl code in MATLAB: 
1) Download repository in full 
2) Run ADDPATH file (found in main folder)
3) Navigate to QMCL Experiments folder and then to either Lorenz 63 or Lorenz 96 subfolder
4) Choose one of the "Generate [Experiment Type] Data" scripts and open it
5) If desired, modify values of parameters in the script to chosen values
6) Run the script

The data generated by the experiment will be saved as a MATLAB array titled with the experiment label
